# Level-One: Associate Profit Splitter

## How The Contract Works and Motivation

### This contract was created to enable a quick and easy way to dissemenate funds to employees, split profit sharing, and distribute shares in a "deferred equity incentive plan".

## How to Send Transactions

### Deploy the Contract:

    1. Before deploying with "transact" button, select a value of "0" first.

    2. Enter your three account addresses under the deploy tab.
    
    3. Make sure your environment is "Injected Web3" and that you are on the proper network, in this case Ropsten Test Network.
    
    4. Click the "transact" button once steps 1-3 are completed.
    
    5. This will bring up Metamask automatically (assuming it is logged in appropriately) where you will review and confirm the transaction for deployment.

### How the Transferred Amount is then Distributed from each of the Contracts

    1. Now that the contract is deployed, look for the red "deposit" button below the deployed contract.

    2. Before selecting that button though, make sure you have now entered an amount of ETH in the "value" field above the "deploy" field.
    
    3. Now select the deposit button and watch for Metamask to pop up with the transaction which you will then confirm.
